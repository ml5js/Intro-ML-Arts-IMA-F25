## Assignment 7
1. Reading:
   - [Chapter 10: Neural Network, Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/) by Daniel Shiffman.
   - [But what _is_ a Neural Network?](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) by 3Blue1Brown.
2. Create your own p5+ml5 sketch that trains a Neural Network with real-time interactive data.
   This can be a prototype of the aforementioned idea or a simple exercise where you run this week's code examples with your own data. Here are some exercise suggestions:

   Try to invent more elegant and intuitive interaction for collecting real-time data beyond clicking buttons?
   What other real-time inputs might you consider beyond mouse position, image pixels, or face/pose/hand tracking? Could you use real-time sensor data?
   What other real-time outputs might you consider beyond color or sound modulation? Could the output be a physical computing device? Multiple outputs like R,G,B values? [Code examples](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-F25/tree/main/07-neural-networks#code-examples)
    - Can you add more keypoints from the hand to the data collection? (All the keypoints?)
    - Can you add more classification categories?
    - Can you create an interface for training and showing the results of model's prediction?
    - Can you turn this into a regression model?
3. Add a link to the post and your p5.js sketch on the [Assignment 7](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-F25/wiki/Assignment-7) Wiki page.
